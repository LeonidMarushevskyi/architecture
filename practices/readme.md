# Development Practices
This directory contains development practices that have been adopted by the project for the purpose of defining standard ways to accomplish our work. The practices, once defined and adopted, will be implemented by development teams for new work, or identified as technical debt when refactoring is required.

# Getting new Practices Adopted
To add or modify a development practice:
  * Create a new branch and add/modify the practice document. 
  * Create a pull request, and describe the change
  * Get the pull request approved by a repo owner
